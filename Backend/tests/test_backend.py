Liberty AI Trade – Backend smoke test.

This file is auto-generated by update_engine/updates/bulk_update.py.
Its primary purpose is to verify that:

  * bulk_update.py executed successfully
  * the updates tree is writable
  * the core updater can detect and sync updated files

The actual backend tests can be extended later if needed.
